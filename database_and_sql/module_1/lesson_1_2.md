# Lesson 1.2: Connecting to Databases

## Course Summary
Master database connections in Python using both file-based systems (SQLite, DuckDB) and server-based systems (PostgreSQL). Learn connection strings, database drivers, and when to choose each database type. Compare low-level libraries (psycopg2) with high-level libraries (SQLAlchemy, SQLModel).

## Learning Objectives
- Connect to SQLite and DuckDB databases
- Establish PostgreSQL connections with psycopg2
- Use SQLAlchemy and SQLModel for high-level connections
- Understand connection strings and parameters
- Choose appropriate database systems and connection libraries

## Key Topics
- File-based vs server-based databases
- Low-level connections (psycopg2) vs high-level (SQLAlchemy/SQLModel)
- Connection string formats and authentication
- Database drivers and adapters
- Connection testing and troubleshooting
